Events Calendar


This is a React TypeScript application that displays a calendar with the ability to view and navigate between months. Users can click on specific days to open a modal, which can later be enhanced to display event details or allow event creation.

Features

- Display a calendar with a grid of days for the current month.
- Clickable day cells that open a modal.
- Navigation buttons to switch between months.
- Month and year title displayed in the header.
- Modular component structure for easy maintainability and extensibility.


Tech Stack

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that provides static typing and improved tooling.

Usage


Once the application is running, you can interact with the calendar as follows:

Click on a day cell to open the modal. The modal will currently be empty.

Use the navigation buttons to switch between months and view upcoming or previous months.

The month and year title in the header will dynamically update based on the current month being displayed.
